# After-Dickens-E-Book
To mark the 200th birth anniversary of Charles Dickens, British Council India hosted a writing competition for young Indian authors to test the spirit of creativity and tribute to their favorite Victorian novelist. British Council (India), Penguin Books and CinnamonTeal Publishing jointly published my article submitted for this competition, in an E-book 'A collection of writings from the Dickens 2012 project'. Read my article in chapter no. 35 of the book.
